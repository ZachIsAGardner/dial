    I found these weird seeds in the trash... I think they're cabbages. (is that right?).

    You think you could help me water them? Maybe somethin' will happen, I dunno.


# This is a COMMENT it does nothing. Good for describing things.

# Everything is on one line, this creates a KEYWORD.
MY_NAME = Zachary
# Only "Zachary" would need to be translated, not the KEY of the KEYWORD (MY_NAME).

# Lines are broken over several lines, this creates a CHAT. The KEY of this CHAT is NAME.ID.
# NAME: The first word will use the profile of the same name if there is one. Otherwise arbitrary.
# ID: Arbitrary word.
NAME.ID =
    This the first textbox/line in a cutscene.

    This is the second one. Also, my name is {MY_NAME}!

    # Here is a TEXTBOX MODEL, it changes the portrait and a few other things. 
    [Portrait: Questioning, CrawlPitch: 1000, CrawlTime: 12000]
    Does that make sense?

    # This prompts the player with a question. The "=>" points to another CHAT that will be used depending on their choice.
    ?Q
        Yeah, makes sense => YES
        I'm confused => NO

*YES =
    I'm glad that makes sense.

*NO = 
    I'm sorry.

NAME.ID_2 =
    This is another CHAT. 
    
    I'll say this if you talk to me again after exhausting the "NAME.ID" CHAT entry.
    
    "*YES" and "*NO" are skipped because they start with a "*".

NAME.ID_3 =
    I will say this after "NAME.ID_2". If you leave the room and come back again, I'll start again from the "NAME.ID" CHAT entry.

    @A1

    I just did an arbitrary ACTION with the name "@A1" defined in the C# code behind.

    # This is a BRANCH. The next CHAT will be decided by an arbitrary condition, in this case whether or not the player is wearing a hat.
    ?B
        (IS_WEARING_HAT) => MENTION_HAT
        => MENTION_NAKED

*MENTION_HAT =
    Oh, I see you're wearing a hat. It's very nice.

*MENTION_NAKED =
    Oh, I see you're not wearing a hat. That means you're naked!

%NAME.ID_4 =
    This CHAT starts with a "%". That means you I will never say this ever again.

    Well, unless you start a new file of course.

    That... <s=10>makes me wanna SHAKE!</s> Okay?

    And it... <f=2,8>makes me wanna FLOAT!</f> Right?

    OH GOD! <c=#ff0000>EVERYTHING IS RED!</c> AHHHHH!

    I'm okay.
